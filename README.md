# Deploy TFC agents in Kubernetes with Waypoint

## Requirements
* Waypoint [binary](https://www.waypointproject.io/downloads)
* Docker installed
* A Kubernetes cluster
* [kubectl]() tool
* [Terraform Cloud account](https://app.terraform.io/app) with a Business tier subscription
* A Terraform Cloud [organization token]()

## The happy path (using Vault for the token)

> NOTE: Jump to the [next section](#create-an-agent-pool-token-in-terraform-cloud) if you want to do it by your own step by step. This section just executes most of the preparation things in a script and using Vault to store your Agent pool token

There is a Bash script included in this repo `script.sh` that uses Vault (assuming that you have admin permissions to create a K/V secrets engine) to store your Agent pool token and configures Waypoint variables. So you can do execute everything by:
```bash
export VAULT_ADDR=<your_vault_address>
export VAULT_TOKEN=<your_vault_token>

kubectl create ns waypoint

waypoint install -platform=kubernetes -nasmespace=waypoint -context-create="waypoint-kubernetes" -accept-tos

./script.sh

waypoint up -app kubernetes
```

## Create an agent pool token in Terraform Cloud

You need to edit or create an agent pool in Terraform Cloud and generate a pool token:

* Creating the agents pool with the API (edit your `TFE_TOKEN` and `TFE_ORG` environment variables with your **organization name** and **organization token** from Terraform Cloud):
```bash
TFC_POOL_ID=$(cat << EOF | curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TFE_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" -X POST -d @- https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/$TFE_ORG/agent-pools | jq -r '.data.id' 
{
  "data": {
    "type": "agent-pools",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "demo-pool"
    }
  }
}
EOF)
```
* Take the `id` of the previous output and use it to generate a token and save it in the `TFC_AGENT_TOKEN` environment variable:
```bash
TFC_AGENT_TOKEN=$(cat << EOF | curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TFE_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" -X POST -d @- https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/agent-pools/$TFC_POOL_ID/authentication-tokens | jq -r '.data.attributes.token'
{
  "data": {
    "type": "authentication-tokens",
    "attributes": {
      "description": "my-agent-token"
    }
  }
}
EOF)
```

## Install Waypoint and initialize the project

You can install Waypoint as a Docker container, in Kubernetes, using Nomad, or runnig standalone. Here, we are going to use the same Kubernetes cluster where we are deploying the TFC agent (we create a `waypoint` namespace to deploy):
```bash
kubectl create ns waypoint

waypoint install -platform=kubernetes -nasmespace=waypoint -context-create="tfc-kubernetes-context" -accept-tos
```

You can verify that you can connect to the Waypoint server:
```
$ waypoint context verify
âœ“ Context "tfc-kubernetes-context" connected successfully.
```

Now, from the root path of this repo (where the `waypoint.hcl` configuration file is located), run:
```bash
waypoint init
```

Connect to your Waypoint UI and check that you see a `tfc-agents` project:

```bash
waypoint ui -authenticate

```

## Deploy the TFC agent with Waypoint

Now it is time to deploy the Terraform Cloud agent. First set the `waypoint config` with the previous variables defined:

```bash
waypoint config set -app agent-kubernetes TFC_AGENT_TOKEN=$TFC_AGENT_TOKEN
waypoint config set -app agent-kubernetes TFC_AGENT_NAME="tfc-agent-demo"
```


```bash
waypoint up -app agent-kubernetes
```

That's all! You will see your TFC agent connected into the pool:
